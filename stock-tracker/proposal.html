<h1>quickStocks</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>quickStocks is meant to give users a hub for all things stock. A user may search for stocks and add/remove tickers to a collection. All stocks in a user's collection will continously update with the latest price and percent up or down for the day. A user may view more information on a stock including a real time graph with multiple data settings (timeframe, technical indicators, etc)</p>
<h3>Potential Problems</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Graph</li>
  <li>API's and limits on calls</li>
  <li>Input validation</li>
</ol>
<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Third party libraries</li>
<li>I assume there shouldn't be limits on a stock api. Otherwise I will need to find a method to limit the updates</li>
<li>Not sure. Will have to learn. If i had to right now with what I know, I'd try to find a list of all valid tickers save an array/string of them to check against the input in order to submit </li>
</ol>
